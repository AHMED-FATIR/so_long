# so_long
This is my implementation of the so_long project from 42 school.

Description : 
So_Long is a small 2D game where the player has to collect all the collectibles 
and reach the exit door while avoiding obstacles and enemies. 
The game is written in C programming language and uses the mlx library for graphics.
How to Play : 
The player can move around the game board using the arrow keys. 
The goal is to collect all the collectibles and reach the exit door while avoiding obstacles and enemies. 
The game ends when the player either collects all the collectibles and reaches the exit door, 
or when the player collides with an obstacle or an enemy.
