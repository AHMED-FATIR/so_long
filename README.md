So_Long
This is my implementation of the so_long project from 42 school.

Description
So_Long is a small 2D game where the player has to collect all the collectibles 
and reach the exit door while avoiding obstacles and enemies. 
The game is written in C programming language and uses the mlx library for graphics.

Installation
To install and run the game, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone
Change into the project directory: cd so_long
Build the game executable: make
Run the game: ./so_long maps/map.ber
Note: The game requires the mlx library and libft library to be installed on your system. 
If they are not installed, you will need to install them first before building the game.

How to Play
The player can move around the game board using the arrow keys. 
The goal is to collect all the collectibles and reach the exit door while avoiding obstacles and enemies. 
The game ends when the player either collects all the collectibles and reaches the exit door, 
or when the player collides with an obstacle or an enemy.
